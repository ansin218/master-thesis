The auth passes and then you supply the server a message to send with a header 'From: user@send.com'. So the server adds the X-Sender header with the username you provided in the authentication, so that the recipient sees the 2 addresses differ (may be a spam attempt). Or it adds the header in all cases.\n\n> So in the end it was a setting. But a very odd one. Where are the names for\n> these assigned?

Bug 50673 either was from a time before that combo worked, or people didn't yet figure out which key combo to use (they tried shift, ctrl, shift+ctrl, ...)\n\nIn Thunderbird, pressing Alt+WindowsKey while swiping over a link actually does *both* actions: it selects the text, *and* it follows the link (this bug)\n\nBtw, in Thunderbird, swiping over a link without modifiers just follows the link, without any selecting.\n\n=> so it seems that Thunderbird does indeed partly get it right. The desired action is there, the problem only is that an *un*desired action is there too.\n\n> \n> Eckard, is there an equivalent fail on Mac?\n> \n> Doesn't happen on windows afaict, using alt+left click to select.","> \n> Doesn't happen on windows afaict, using alt+left click to select.",'mozilla','vseerror',0,None,0,0,0,0,0

But then there may be a reason for the choice of the size, for example,\nexternal specification requirement, etc. This is something I don't know much.\n\nThe reason I did not attack and modify the assertion() individually is that\nunlike the bug Bug 1243117 where the issue seemed to be only in a couple of places and manual changes were not that difficult, the field member seems to be used in many places, and tracing its use was rather difficult.\nA onetime change of type at the declaration looked an easier option.\n\nLet me investigate a little more.\nAlthough I do not use LDAP at home, but many enterprises do and\nwe should keep LDAP code as clean as possible.\n[In that sense, the use of variadic macro for error reporting with variable # of\nparameters will be more in demand than this patch :-( ]\n\nTIA",'[In that sense, the use of variadic macro for error reporting with variable # of\nparameters will be more in demand than this patch :-( ]\n\nTIA','ishikawa','rkent',1,'alternative, pro',0,1,1,0,0

I have experienced twice in a row the timings originally describes, but then a couple of tests did not reproduce. I then reproduced several times with timings which I did not expect.\n\nI feel like exactly what happens depends on the timing of my typing. Waiting for too long between keypresses seems to yield different results. There might be both a lower and an upper limit on the delay between keypresses in order to reproduce, but I can hardly see why and what the upper limit would be.

So maybe similar and additional issues\nmay pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were\nthe case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of\nvarious packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly\nsecurity-related, into the components that are distributed using its\npackaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than\nhalf a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not\ncompile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)\n\nFor your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing\nthe issues, here is my setup.\n\nPC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox\n\t\t (hosted on win7 64 bits)\n\t\t [This is where I found out after running test\n\t\t overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce \n\t\t timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]\n\nPC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer\n\t\t (hosted on win7 64 bits)\n\t\t I briefly checked and found that removing the patch\n\t\t DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that\n\t\t environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)\n\t\t \n     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as\n     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available\n     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted\n     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.\n\nUsed Display Resolution? : 1280x768\n\n    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local\n    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.\n    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.\n    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.\n    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &\n    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0\n    sleep 2\n    oclock &\n    xfwm4 &\n\n    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.\n    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as \n    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window\n    manager IMHO.\n\n[Curious] What about TryServer\n\nOS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)\n\nDisplay Resolution?\n\tNot sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.\n\tCome to think of it, how is it done?\n\nWhat is the window manager???\n\nAnyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment\nwhere TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors\neven without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.\n(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test\nas possible so did not realize that I no\nlonger need this patch any more.)\n\nAs for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the\npatch state, again.\nI will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still\npersist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,\nbut if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean\nsomething useful.\n\nThank you again for your time and review.\n\nI will report what I find on 64-bit version later today or tomorrow at the latest hopefully.","Thank you aceman and hiro (I am using the short handle name if you don't mind).",'ishikawa','NULL',0,None,0,0,0,0,0
