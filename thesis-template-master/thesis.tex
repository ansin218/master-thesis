Rationale knowledge is particularly important during software maintenance and evolution
because it is valuable to understand the rationale behind the previous decisions. Rationale
knowledge, in the context of software engineering, corresponds to the reasoning and logic
behind the decision taken during all the phases of software development. Such decisive con-
versations are spread out across various mediums. Rationale may be discussed face-to-face
or over other modes of communication such as chats, emails, or issue trackers to mention a
few. It is thus important to extract and mine these messages that were exchanged over dif-
ferent modes of communication to manage the rationale. Open sourced projects comes with
licenses that provides the rights to study, develop and also contribute to the same. Therefore,
this research focuses on mining rationale from open sources projects such as Apache Lucene,
Mozilla Thunderbird and Ubuntu. These rationale captured can help developers analyze
decisions, improve understandability, and document the pertinent information better.

\chapter{Data Collection}

This chapter describes the datasets used to carry out the research and the collection of data from the three sources: Apache Lucene, Mozilla Thunderbird and Ubuntu. All three sources mentioned use different issue trackers. Apache Lucene uses JIRA owned by Atlassian Inc., Mozilla Thunderbird uses Bugzilla developed by Mozilla Foundation and Ubuntu uses Launchpad created by Canonical Ltd. 

\section{Data Scraping and Parsing}

In this section, we explore how the data was scraped for issues trackers and commit logs from each of the three sources: Apache Lucene, Mozilla Thunderbird and Ubuntu. 

\subsection{Issue Trackers Dataset}
This section investigates how data was obtained from issue trackers of Apache Lucene, Mozilla Thunderbird and Ubuntu. 

\subsubsection{Apache Lucene}
Apache Lucene is an open sourced high performance text search engine written in Java by Doug Cutting in 1999. The project was donated to Apache Foundation in the year 2001. To develop and maintain the software, the issue tracker called JIRA developed by Atlassian is used. At the time of conducting this research, the total number of issues were 7940. However, only 7932 issues were fetched since some issues could have been deleted by the moderators, contained non-English characters or had no comments.

In JIRA, each issue gives us an option to export all the data needed for the research in XML, JSON or Word. However, JIRA also provides a link to get all these information needed for upto 1000 issues in XML. This link was altered 8 times to cover 7932 issues. The XML data from the links were saved locally as XML files. The XML ElementTree API available for Python was used to parse the XML files and extract the necessary data. 

\subsubsection{Mozilla Thunderbird}
Mozilla Thunderbird is an open sourced cross platform email client developed by Mozilla Foundation with initial release dating back to 2003. The issue tracker used by Mozilla Thunderbird is Bugzilla which was developed by Mozilla Foundation itself. The oldest issue, however, dates back to June 2007 and the number of issues fetched were 4367. Like Apache Lucene, issues with no comments were ignored. 

As mentioned earlier, JIRA gave us the option to get all the data needed for upto 1000 issues on each request. However, Bugzilla did not have any option that was similar. In the case of Bugzilla, data for each issue had to be accessed individually. Another drawback of Bugzilla when compared to JIRA was that the data when exported did not have the comments for the relevant issues. Hence, all the necessary data, including the comments, for the issues in Bugzilla were scraped using BeautifulSoup, a library for Python to scrape data from the web. 

\subsubsection{Ubuntu}
Ubuntu is an open sourced operating system developed by Canonical Ltd. in the year 2004. The same team is also responsible for having their own issue tracking system known as Launchpad which also houses the issues of Ubuntu. The number of issues fetched since the beginning of the project are 28,429. Issues with no comments were not scraped, just like in the case of Apache Lucene and Mozilla Thunderbird. Additionally, a major problem faced while scraping data from Launchpad was that there were abundant number of downlinks. When these links were accessed manually, they kept loading until getting timed out and returned 404 error while scraping.

Launchpad did not have its export option to fetch mass number of issues and its comments. Hence, each and every issue had to be scraped one at a time. In addition, not all the issues had the same HTML tags and attributes for the comments section. Launchpad provides individual link for each of the comment of the pertinent issue and hence, the comments were scraped by obtaining the individual links for comments. All the links were requested and the necessary data was retrieved using BeautifulSoup, the library mentioned in the previous section.

\subsection{Commit Logs Dataset}
This section scrutinizes how the data of commit messages were obtained for Apache Lucene, Mozilla Thunderbird and Ubuntu.

\subsubsection{Apache Lucene}
Apache Lucene uses Git for its version control, which was developed by Linus Torvald and released in 2005. Apache Lucene along with SOLR is hosted together within the same repository on GitHub. The repository was cloned to local environment in the system to retrieve the commit logs. Git allows the logs of the repository to be exported in TXT format and this is the method that has been used to get all the logs for Apache Lucene. However, a parsing script was additionally written in Python to obtain all the commit id, author, date and commit message respectively. These information was later stored in a MySQL database. 

\subsubsection{Mozilla Thunderbird}
Mozilla Thunderbird uses Mercurial for its version control, which was developed by Matt Mackall and released in 2005. The Mozilla Thunderbird project in a repository owned by Mozilla. This repository was cloned to the system to extract the commit logs. Like Git, Mercurial also offers users an option to extract the entire commit log history in TXT format. This data was parsed using a script written in Python to retrieve all the commit id, author, date and commit message respectively. The retrieved information was eventually stored in a MySQL database. 

\subsubsection{Ubuntu}
Ubuntu makes use of Bazaar primarily for its version control, which was developed by Martin Pool in 2005 and maintained by Canonical Ltd. The Ubuntu project is hosted on Launchpad platform using Bazaar. Due to too numerous repositories, the entire Ubuntu project could not be cloned individually. However, a script in Python was written using the BeautifulSoup library; similar to the script used for fetching data from issue trackers for Ubuntu. Identical problems of many downlinks were encountered and hence, only those that were up were fetched automatically. A MySQL database was used to store all of these information. 

\section{Data Storage}

\textit{Note: If you leave out the section ``Current system'', you can rename this section into ``Requirements''.}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\item [FR2] \textbf{Short Title}: Short Description.
\item [FR3] \textbf{Short Title}: Short Description.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\textit{Note: List and describe all nonfunctional requirements of your system. Also mention requirements that you were not able to realize. Categorize them using the FURPS+ model described in \cite{bruegge2004object} without the category \textbf{functionality} that was already covered with the functional requirements.}

\begin{itemize}
\item [NFR1] \textbf{Category}: Short Description.
\item [NFR2] \textbf{Category}: Short Description.

\textbf{Important:} Make sure to describe the most important use cases using the use case table template. Also describe the rationale of the use case model, i.e. why you modeled it like you show it in the diagram.}

\subsection{Analysis Object Model}

\textit{Note: This subsection should contain a UML Class Diagram showing the most important objects, attributes, methods and relations of your application domain including taxonomies using specification inheritance (see \cite{bruegge2004object}). Do not insert objects, attributes or methods of the solution domain.
\textbf{Important:} Make sure to describe the analysis object model thoroughly in the text so that readers are able to understand the diagram. Also write about the rationale how and why you modeled the concepts like this.}

\subsection{Dynamic Model}

\textit{Note: This subsection should contain dynamic UML diagrams. These can be a UML state diagrams, UML communication diagrams or UML activity diagrams.\textbf{Important:} Make sure to describe the diagram and its rationale in the text. \textbf{Do not use UML sequence diagrams.}}
