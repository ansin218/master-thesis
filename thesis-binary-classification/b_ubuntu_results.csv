356,898,28204,3088,"Not yet... I've tried 4.7.0-040700 on a 64GB arm64 system with no
failures.  I've also tried 4.4.0-33.52 on a 32GB ARM64 system with no
failures.
Currently trying 4.4.0-21.37 on the 32GB system and 4.4.0-34.53 on the
64GB system.  I initially saw this on  4.4.0-31.50 on both systems, so
I had expected 21.37 to fail immediately, but it's survived two passes
so far. :/

362,2192,28572,3131,"Interesting. It appears this might be a shell/Mir/MirAL bug.
The problem is that Mir shells are sending focus events to surfaces that never receive focus events on normal X desktops. Sending a focus event to a menu that has specified never to receive focus (or is override redirect) is not directly a problem. However it creates a big problem indirectly because an unfocus of the app window happens before a focus of the menu. It's actually the unfocus of the main app window that makes Firefox think that it should then close its menu (or utility bar) immediately. So menus pop up and then vanish instantly, because the app window has lost focus (same kind of issue as recent Unity8 bug 1662733).
The only way to work around this in Xmir is to remove the focus logic we did for the OSK. Then the app window never receives unfocus events and it won't close the menu prematurely. I may write a workaround to let you do that but it's not a solution...
A proper solution requires that Mir surfaces (like some menus) should be able to flag never to send them focus events. And thus when menus open, the app window never receives an unfocus event. This could also solve Unity8 bug 1662733.

So we apparently have no way out other than to ensure that the SHELL does not ever focus certain popups (as chosen by the toolkit). Xmir already has all the information it needs to make this decision and is only lacking a Mir client API to communicate it to the shell.
Fortunately our Unity8 WM design already provides means for us to do this, and we have not yet implemented it in Mir (comments 16-17).
Also remember that Xmir ignoring focus/unfocus events to work around such bugs is unacceptable, because that leads to the OSK either not appearing or never disappearing.","I am aware of the above ICCCM spec and that Xmir doesn't follow it fully, but that's also possibly not the issue here.",Daniel van Vugt (vanvugt),NULL,1,issue,1,0,0,0,0

I'm using 0.25-fixes and not getting core dumps.  I've also set the core

- the new version uses Storage (libstorable-perl is included in perl-package)
- some new values are given (e.g. replication)

I don't know if I already asked you this or not, but if we push more patches upstream this week we will not have commit IDs for them until they are pulled into either James Bottomely or Christoph's or Linus tree, will you accept a patch if we only have the scsi misc mailing list url for it?

The Vivid kernel will be introduced back into 14.04 in our 14.04.3 point release so these will naturally be included there as well.  Do keep us posted on any additional patches still making their way upstream.

1070,1752,53448,6155,"Thanks.  I've confirmed all of the patches listed in comment #6 are indeed already included in our v3.19 based kernel for Vivid.  The Vivid kernel will be introduced back into 14.04 in our 14.04.3 point release so these will naturally be included there as well.  Do keep us posted on any additional patches still making their way upstream.

1073,1755,53448,6155,"Thanks.  I've confirmed all of the patches listed in comment #6 are indeed already included in our v3.19 based kernel for Vivid.  The Vivid kernel will be introduced back into 14.04 in our 14.04.3 point release so these will naturally be included there as well.  Do keep us posted on any additional patches still making their way upstream.

This is an old bug, as far as i remember that we tested it and the performance still not as expected.

The bug was filed against vivid which is no longer maintained. The original submitter had requested certain patches be back-ported to vivid because they supposedly fixed an issue.
The requested patches were back-ported and they didn't fix the issue the submitter purported that they fix.
So I wanted to know two things:
1. Does the reported issue still appear in latest releases such as xenial(16.04)
2. If so does this issue appear in the mainline kernel as well?
This will determine if the reported issue is an Ubuntu specific issue or if the general mainline linux kernel needs fixing.
If you can re-run the tests on 1 & 2 that would be very helpful, but it would also help if you could provide the exact configuration and steps you use so that I can try and reproduce your tests.

1138,1515,54349,6293,"Hi Christopher,
Sometime ago, after I reported this bug, I had already updated my BIOS to 2.98:
~ $ sudo dmidecode -s bios-version && sudo dmidecode -s bios-release-date
K01 v02.98
03/18/2015
Since then I've got less video issues, but I cannot tell if they were fixed by the BIOS update or by some other update like the new kernel I have now (3.19).
Those 1-2 minutes freezes definitely have stopped or at least they are not so frequent. But sometimes my Unity still freezes for a few seconds like the first time when I press the Super key to bring up the Dash Home screen or when I run apt-get install and it starts configuring some package. I don't know if they are related. And also I am still seeing i915 crashes and errors in dmesg:

As explained in companion ticket in Ubuntu (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/smarty/+bug/44404) there's a simple way to do so by adding a .ini file in the conf.d dir of PHP5 (at least starting with PHP5.1, I think).
Still it won't be possible though until bug #497453 is fixed.
Hope this helps.

tags 290176 - wontfix
thanks
As explained in companion ticket in Ubuntu (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/smarty/+bug/44404) there's a simple way to do so by adding a .ini file in the conf.d dir of PHP5 (at least starting with PHP5.1, I think).
Still it won't be possible though until bug #497453 is fixed.
Hope this helps.
P.S.: wasn't tested for Samrty but for Zend framework (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/zend-framework/+bug/220719).
Best regards,

Your iwconfig output doesn't show any link quality or even a signal/noise level when you're connected to your network.

Usually the absence of that information indicates that your wireless driver isn't reporting it, but I would expect NM to run into some issues if that was the case.

1847,2119,100061,14954,"This appears to be a problem with the 2.6.31 kernel drivers.
From Jaron Wilson on the LIRC mailing list:
The root of the problem is that the i2c client model changed significantly
in 2.6.31, and some drivers (such as the cx18 driver for the HVR-1600)
weren't updated soon enough for the 2.6.31 window, meaning even ir-kbd-
i2c is broken with them as well. What needs to happen is some
patchification of those drivers in a 2.6.31.x stable release, I think
(going to ping some v4l/dvb folks on that).
What we did on Dave's box is build the cx18 driver (well, all v4l-dvb
drivers) from v4l-dvb mercurial, and all was well again.
Short version:
hg clone http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb
cd v4l-dvb
make
make install
If you get errors about some driver or another not building, if its
one you don't need, you can disable it from being built in v4l/
Makefile.media (the firedtv driver was failing on Dave's system for
some reason).
If you update your kernel to another that still doesn't have the
required i2c fixage in it, you'll lose the fixes from v4l-dvb, but can
get 'em back by going back into that v4l-dvb checkout and rebuilding
(after doing a 'make distclean' so the build uses the new kernel
headers instead of the prior one).",This appears to be a problem with the 2.6.31 kernel drivers.,Jeremy Yoder (jyoder),NULL,1,issue,1,0,0,0,0

one you don't need, you can disable it from being built in v4l/
Makefile.media (the firedtv driver was failing on Dave's system for
some reason).
If you update your kernel to another that still doesn't have the
required i2c fixage in it, you'll lose the fixes from v4l-dvb, but can
get 'em back by going back into that v4l-dvb checkout and rebuilding
(after doing a 'make distclean' so the build uses the new kernel
headers instead of the prior one).","What we did on Dave's box is build the cx18 driver (well, all v4l-dvb
drivers) from v4l-dvb mercurial, and all was well again.",Jeremy Yoder (jyoder),NULL,1,alternative,0,1,0,0,0
1851,2123,100061,14954,"This appears to be a problem with the 2.6.31 kernel drivers.
From Jaron Wilson on the LIRC mailing list:
The root of the problem is that the i2c client model changed significantly
in 2.6.31, and some drivers (such as the cx18 driver for the HVR-1600)
weren't updated soon enough for the 2.6.31 window, meaning even ir-kbd-
i2c is broken with them as well. What needs to happen is some
patchification of those drivers in a 2.6.31.x stable release, I think
(going to ping some v4l/dvb folks on that).

Just for fun I removed my compiled version of lircd and installed the current lirc package (apt-get remove lirc and then apt-get install lirc).  This installs the 0.8.6 lirc...

I hope someone here can give me some guidance.
I am using the HVR-1600 and am trying to get the Ir functions - both ways - working.
I have Ubuntu  10.4 - 2.6.32-21-generic (#32-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 16 08:10:02 UTC 2010) - installed.  Myth is up to date and I think I have newest V4L / CX18 installed and working (mostly).  I can simultaneously record one 1080i ATSC stream and one NTSC using the SV1 with acceptable results.
I can't figure out what I should do to get both (most important is send - to control a Directv receiver) working on the backend machine.

I hope someone here can give me some guidance.
I am using the HVR-1600 and am trying to get the Ir functions - both ways - working.
I have Ubuntu  10.4 - 2.6.32-21-generic (#32-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 16 08:10:02 UTC 2010) - installed.  Myth is up to date and I think I have newest V4L / CX18 installed and working (mostly).  I can simultaneously record one 1080i ATSC stream and one NTSC using the SV1 with acceptable results.
I can't figure out what I should do to get both (most important is send - to control a Directv receiver) working on the backend machine.

After some testing with various backgrounds it seems that the delay is always specific to each background image and I was unlucky enough to select the worst of them which is the one with the wafer/processors (third one below @ 2560x1440).
Some of the images I tried are the following (from simplest to most complex):
http://wallpaperswide.com/ubuntu_desktop_blue-wallpapers.html

2560x1440 - 1.1MB - 25.9sec delay
As we expected, a bigger resolution and/or file size produces a bigger delay. However the last wafer/processors images have something unique that causes this huge delay. Maybe it's my PC that's getting old (AMD X2 4400+, 2GB RAM, made in 2005) so it would be nice if we could test those last background images on a faster pc.

The log also contains the kernel command linke - although you may have to use 'nomodeset' to get nvidia to work (that was the reason it was in mine - when I removed the graphics card, I forgot to revert the grub options).","The log also contains the kernel command linke - although you may have to use 'nomodeset' to get nvidia to work (that was the reason it was in mine - when I removed the graphics card, I forgot to revert the grub options).",Ketil Malde (ketil-ii),NULL,1,"alternative, pro",0,1,1,0,0

2503,1121,129156,23003,"Have you tried the *vga=###* where ### is one of the valid VGA values,
using this on the GRUB linux kernel line?  This has worked for me on some
recent kernels/x-servers where xrandr can't force the screen resolution.  I
have used this with *nouveau.noaccel=1* and sometimes *acpi=off* in problem
situations to force the resolution where hardware acceleration enabled just
causes the graphics processor to freeze, causing a reboot necessary.  This
does NOT work on GNOME, KDE, Unity, Cinnamon, etc., but does work for Mate
and Xfce without Compiz enabled.
Hope this helps.

2511,1129,129156,23003,"Have you tried the *vga=###* where ### is one of the valid VGA values,
using this on the GRUB linux kernel line?  This has worked for me on some
recent kernels/x-servers where xrandr can't force the screen resolution.  I
have used this with *nouveau.noaccel=1* and sometimes *acpi=off* in problem
situations to force the resolution where hardware acceleration enabled just
causes the graphics processor to freeze, causing a reboot necessary.  This
does NOT work on GNOME, KDE, Unity, Cinnamon, etc., but does work for Mate
and Xfce without Compiz enabled.
Hope this helps.

no sound from speakers, light sound from headphones.
From live CD (USB installer 14.04) no sound.
Speakers worked perfectly on old 10.04.
Perfect on dual-booted WinXp (sorry!)
Will try Mint.
Any suggestions?

1) sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/vmware/view/pkcs11/

There is a possible race condition with the device file and the select command.
We have had a very sketchy attempt at a fix at ( this is not a
complete fix as much as working with the observed issue ):
https://github.com/Openand-I/haveged/tree/oi
The main changes can be summarized as:
Generic Linux based OS:
- Create a new random device at /dev/entropy/random to mitigate
possible file based locking issues
- Simply restrict write_wakeup_threshold to 4064 in the code itself.
- Change select to epoll. This has the added advantage of blocking
till there is any actual entropy depletion, immediately replenishing
the pool upon every use. It therefore does not loop when no entropy is
required.
- Two epolls, one for reading and one for writing.
- Overflowing the pool with an extra byte. There is some strange
reasoning behind this as it kinda sorta releases the entropy gathered
by the kernel till time.
Android specific:
- Sleep upon device sleep
- Every 4 hours, a simple touch to the threshold parameters file again
kinda sorta feels like releases entropy gathered by kernel till time.
This can possibly be solved in Linux ( which doesn't sleep ) by
setting read_wakeup_threshold to 8.
Works excellent. Verified using strace.
There some very distinct usability improvements on both Android and
Linux, including GUI responsiveness and network connectivity due to
faster random number generation. Will almost certainly help virtual
machines too as they are entropy starved.
Invited author to take a look at this.
There is still the problem of a very slow (u)random device that slows
the entire Linux ecosystem down. It is recommended instead to replace
the (u)random device according to the fortuna ( at least 5x faster )

https://github.com/Openand-I/haveged/tree/oi
The main changes can be summarized as:
Generic Linux based OS:
- Create a new random device at /dev/entropy/random to mitigate
possible file based locking issues
- Simply restrict write_wakeup_threshold to 4064 in the code itself.
- Change select to epoll. This has the added advantage of blocking
till there is any actual entropy depletion, immediately replenishing
the pool upon every use. It therefore does not loop when no entropy is
required.
- Two epolls, one for reading and one for writing.
- Overflowing the pool with an extra byte. There is some strange
reasoning behind this as it kinda sorta releases the entropy gathered
by the kernel till time.
Android specific:
- Sleep upon device sleep
- Every 4 hours, a simple touch to the threshold parameters file again
kinda sorta feels like releases entropy gathered by kernel till time.
This can possibly be solved in Linux ( which doesn't sleep ) by
setting read_wakeup_threshold to 8.
Works excellent. Verified using strace.
There some very distinct usability improvements on both Android and
Linux, including GUI responsiveness and network connectivity due to
faster random number generation. Will almost certainly help virtual
machines too as they are entropy starved.
Invited author to take a look at this.
There is still the problem of a very slow (u)random device that slows
the entire Linux ecosystem down. It is recommended instead to replace
the (u)random device according to the fortuna ( at least 5x faster )
