I now experience issue #2 again on the machine I described. I have experienced twice in a row the timings originally describes, but then a couple of tests did not reproduce. I then reproduced several times with timings which I did not expect.

I feel like exactly what happens depends on the timing of my typing. Waiting for too long between keypresses seems to yield different results. There might be both a lower and an upper limit on the delay between keypresses in order to reproduce, but I can hardly see why and what the upper limit would be. This is just a hypothesis.","(In reply to Filipus Klutiero from comment #2)

I now experience issue #2 again on the machine I described. I have experienced twice in a row the timings originally describes, but then a couple of tests did not reproduce. I then reproduced several times with timings which I did not expect.

I feel like exactly what happens depends on the timing of my typing. Waiting for too long between keypresses seems to yield different results.

So, discovery is definitely an issue there. I have the menu bar hidden, because it moves around between my Vista box at home and XP at work, and I can't cope with that (or customise the problem away), so the only place I could put the buttons is on the Tab bar. However, buttons on the Tab bar don't work properly, as they don't display the text next to the picture, so that renders them useless for me. It would be brilliant if this did work properly, as I could get rid of the Mail Toolbar altogether and put the icons all in the Tab Bar where there is always lots of space.

So for me at least, Jim Porter's suggestion to add to the other toolbars doesn't work because of other problems inherent in these toolbars.

I can confirm the Problem with thunderbird 38.3.0 (on fedora 23).
I can also confirm the workaround for mutt signatures to add -md SHA1
to the smime_sign openssl command.

At the error message is wrong. It indicates that the message content
does not match the signature. But the signature is valid (as manual
openssl commands prove, and also mutt verifies the signature ok).

No, I'm not seeing the regular crashes like I used to --- that stopped quite some time ago, fortunately; I should have updated here.

This fixes the problem. However it requires string changes and a new prompt. Without string changes and the new prompt, you can only cancel the sync changes if you click cancel while still on the Sync and Storage screen. As soon as you move from Sync to another config page for the account or to another account, the sync changes are effectively automatically saved. So to solve this, when moving to a new page, but before the Sync page is exited, I put up a prompt to allow the user to cancel or save any sync changes made. The prompt only appears if a sync change was actually made on the Sync/Storage/Advanced screen.
A possible improvement might be to provide a 3 button prompt so you can also remain on the Sync & Storage and do further edits there instead of moving to the new page.","Created attachment 8913061

Thank you taking this bug and to help improving TB.

Asking for ui-review without a requestee makes no sense. No one feels responsible and the request could stay for ever.

For TB the best person to ask for ui-r would be bwinton. If he would be too busy you could also ask me ;)

I think the position of the search is good but I gave ui-r- because the search field should be done more obvious like the other search fields. I'll attach a screenshot how it should look.

For TB the best person to ask for ui-r would be bwinton. If he would be too busy you could also ask me ;)

I think the position of the search is good but I gave ui-r- because the search field should be done more obvious like the other search fields. I'll attach a screenshot how it should look.

With this in mind go on with your work to implement this feature.","With this in mind go on with your work to implement this feature.","richard.marti","NULL","1","alternative","0","1","0","0","0"

This seems to be another case of similar-but-not-quite-the-same bugs existing on both Thunderbird and Firefox.

In Firefox, pressing Alt+WindowsKey while swiping over a link works fine to select it (the windows key is needed in addition to Alt, to prevent the window manager to act on it, and just move the entire window). Bug 50673 either was from a time before that combo worked, or people didn't yet figure out which key combo to use (they tried shift, ctrl, shift+ctrl, ...)

In Thunderbird, pressing Alt+WindowsKey while swiping over a link actually does *both* actions: it selects the text, *and* it follows the link (this bug)

Btw, in Thunderbird, swiping over a link without modifiers just follows the link, without any selecting.

=> so it seems that Thunderbird does indeed partly get it right. The desired action is there, the problem only is that an *un*desired action is there too.

Yes, my folders are IMAP.

Your question caused me to think of trying to access the folders via
a Webmail client.  We have IPSWITCH IMail Server.  With this method,
the subfolders appear, both the names that I see under Thunderbird and
the names from before the rename and delete.  However, none of these
subfolders display any messages, not even the subfolder that has
messages accessible under Thunderbird.

involves both inaccessible subfolders and lost messages.","(In reply to Wayne Mery (:wsmwk, use Needinfo for questions) from comment #2)

the subfolders appear, both the names that I see under Thunderbird and
the names from before the rename and delete.  However, none of these

involves both inaccessible subfolders and lost messages.","We have IPSWITCH IMail Server.","lstout","vseerror","0",NULL,"0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, my folders are IMAP.

Thunderbird updated itself to version 38.2.0 today.

If you mean:  Did the status of the subfolders involved in the problem improve?  Then the answer is No.  Both of the subfolders are still greyed out and italicized, and one of them still shows as having no messages.

My next step will be to have the folder restored again.  This will answer whether a freshly restored folder gets corrupted when Thunderbird 38.2.0 comes up.

Thank you for your review.

I was trying to remove compiler warnings from under C-C portion of the compilation.

I was aware of the possibility of 32-bit signed vs unsigned range issue that may change the behavior as you correctly noted.
That is why I wondered if I may want to increase the width of the entity so that even if it becomes signed, 64-bit width comfortably can incorporate the 32-bit unsigned value. But then there may be a reason for the choice of the size, for example,
external specification requirement, etc. This is something I don't know much.

The reason I did not attack and modify the assertion() individually is that
unlike the bug Bug 1243117 where the issue seemed to be only in a couple of places and manual changes were not that difficult, the field member seems to be used in many places, and tracing its use was rather difficult.
A onetime change of type at the declaration looked an easier option.

Let me investigate a little more.
Although I do not use LDAP at home, but many enterprises do and
we should keep LDAP code as clean as possible.
[In that sense, the use of variadic macro for error reporting with variable # of
parameters will be more in demand than this patch :-( ]

Thank you for your review.

I was trying to remove compiler warnings from under C-C portion of the compilation.

I was aware of the possibility of 32-bit signed vs unsigned range issue that may change the behavior as you correctly noted.
That is why I wondered if I may want to increase the width of the entity so that even if it becomes signed, 64-bit width comfortably can incorporate the 32-bit unsigned value. But then there may be a reason for the choice of the size, for example,
external specification requirement, etc. This is something I don't know much.

The reason I did not attack and modify the assertion() individually is that
unlike the bug Bug 1243117 where the issue seemed to be only in a couple of places and manual changes were not that difficult, the field member seems to be used in many places, and tracing its use was rather difficult.
A onetime change of type at the declaration looked an easier option.

Let me investigate a little more.
Although I do not use LDAP at home, but many enterprises do and
we should keep LDAP code as clean as possible.
[In that sense, the use of variadic macro for error reporting with variable # of
parameters will be more in demand than this patch :-( ]

That is why I wondered if I may want to increase the width of the entity so that even if it becomes signed, 64-bit width comfortably can incorporate the 32-bit unsigned value. But then there may be a reason for the choice of the size, for example,
external specification requirement, etc. This is something I don't know much.

The reason I did not attack and modify the assertion() individually is that
unlike the bug Bug 1243117 where the issue seemed to be only in a couple of places and manual changes were not that difficult, the field member seems to be used in many places, and tracing its use was rather difficult.
A onetime change of type at the declaration looked an easier option.

Let me investigate a little more.
Although I do not use LDAP at home, but many enterprises do and
we should keep LDAP code as clean as possible.
[In that sense, the use of variadic macro for error reporting with variable # of
parameters will be more in demand than this patch :-( ]

ldap-sign-compare.patch

Here is an updated patch.
Actually this time, all the signed vs unsigned issues (warnings turned to errors by -Werror=sign-compare) are addressed.
But since it was deemed in 
Bug 1294260 - Fix Mailnews compiler warnings after they got upgraded to errors in bug 1292463 (Move MOZ_C{,XX}_SUPPORTS_WARNING to python configure) 
that ldap does not need to be handled at this moment by ignoring
-Werror=sign-compare, I am not asking for a review this time.
I am uploading the patch that I used to compile ldap directory with -Werror=sign-compare and some more in September.

There maybe a few more places where I handled additional issues such as
size of int vs long.

HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT TOUCHED the glaring problem, during 64-bit build, of 64-bit pointer first cast into 32-bit int and the two entities are subtracted and compared to an int (long?) value.
We should not cast the pointers to 32-bit value in 64-bit build.
I think this was the reason that I thought the hashing in ldap code does not work on 64-bit build. (The code was only looking at the lower 32-bit of 64-bit pointer, but I digress. So there is a very small chance that two items collides in a strange manner in 64-bit build.)

ldap-sign-compare.patch

Here is an updated patch.
Actually this time, all the signed vs unsigned issues (warnings turned to errors by -Werror=sign-compare) are addressed.
But since it was deemed in 
Bug 1294260 - Fix Mailnews compiler warnings after they got upgraded to errors in bug 1292463 (Move MOZ_C{,XX}_SUPPORTS_WARNING to python configure) 
that ldap does not need to be handled at this moment by ignoring
-Werror=sign-compare, I am not asking for a review this time.
I am uploading the patch that I used to compile ldap directory with -Werror=sign-compare and some more in September.

There maybe a few more places where I handled additional issues such as
size of int vs long.

HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT TOUCHED the glaring problem, during 64-bit build, of 64-bit pointer first cast into 32-bit int and the two entities are subtracted and compared to an int (long?) value.
We should not cast the pointers to 32-bit value in 64-bit build.

ldap-sign-compare.patch (with ber_len_t change, too)

I know this is an external package and nobody wants to fix the issues concerning signed vs unsigned comparison, etc.

I threw in another fix.

FYI, I modified the long-standing issue of ber_len_t being defined as 32-bit entity even under 64-bit build (to produce 64-bit binary).
[I think this was what I thought would be a potential hash table bogus collision
when 64-bit binary was created: the difference of 64-bit pointer is compared only the 32-bit lower value only, thus we can possibly see an incorrect match or something.]
Latest GCC warns the casting of 64-bit pointer into 32 value at compile time.

Anyway, since it seems that this ber_len_t can be as large as 64 bit, I simply
set it to size_t and all is well as far as compilation goes AFTER a few casts
and outright incorrect prototypes size were used interchangeably and my change above uncovered them.

If someone is serious creating TB 64-bit version that uses LDAP extensively
in a corporate setup, this patch may help.

Well, the real problem is I'm not aware of how viable displaying email in standards mode is, given that Outlook renders email with Word's layout engine, which is more or less IE 5.5. Always forcing the message to display in standards mode or in quirks mode is a relatively simple change; gating this on the doctype of a text/html part is difficult (due to the architecture of libmime) or impossible (if we have two HTML parts with different doctypes, we're hosed, since we combine everything in one document).

If I had , it would be possible to relegate every part to a seamless iframe and let that do the doctype magic for us, but it's unclear how amenable our architecture is to that solution.","(In reply to Boris Zbarsky (:bz) from comment #3)

The add-on stores all the information about scheduled messages, i.e., when they are scheduled to be sent, how often, etc., in message headers in the drafts themselves.

Because that's not the SLA I've made to my users, and what you're proposing would be a significant change in behavior and cause an increased risk of scheduled messages being sent out that the user didn't intend to send out.

What the documentation says, and what the add-on has always promised, is that if you start editing a draft, any scheduled send on that draft is canceled.

That means that people expect that they can cancel a scheduled send merely by opening a draft for editing and then closing it. In fact, that is the documented, supported method for canceling a scheduled send.

Furthermore, people expect that if they open a scheduled draft to make changes and then change their mind about editing it and close the compose window, the scheduled send is still canceled.

The behavior you propose might have been appropriate had I chosen to do things that way from the start. However, given the choice that I made way back when I added this functionality and that changing the behavior would risk messages being sent out that users didn't intend to be sent out, I can't change it now.

Well, 24 people filed bugs on it, so it's important to at least a few of us. (I'm sure there are other features that have a lot more bugs open on them.)

(I yearn for the old days when I could compose my email using vi and then pipe it to fmt or any other command of my choosing.)

> So realistically, this corner is unlikely to get much attention.

Maybe not, but at least no one can say that the problem is not documented.

earliest crashes containing nsMsgSearchTerm::MatchString are 45.1.0 like bp-8b6d0f70-baaf-4ac1-ae0d-fac442161109 but this is long after bug 1089298. Perhaps it was crashing in previous versions with a different signature?

earliest crashes containing nsMsgSearchTerm::MatchString are 45.1.0 like bp-8b6d0f70-baaf-4ac1-ae0d-fac442161109 but this is long after bug 1089298. Perhaps it was crashing in previous versions with a different signature?

However...while I recognize the problems with exposing preferences, the only people who would actually dive into them would be those with serious and distinctive expectations about their address searches -- I suggest that -those- people would tend to be power users.

I'm no longer a Thunderbird contributor or reviewer.  Having said that, your patch makes a change to Gecko, not Thunderbird-specific code, so Thunderbird reviewers can't approve it either.  Also, I'm very confident this change wouldn't be accepted into Gecko core since it's synchronous IO on the main thread not using the existing IO APIs.

I don't think the appshells close stdin, so you can probably use existing (async) API's on the existing stdin file descriptor or something like that.

1) TB main 3pane, folder list with nested subfolders (inbox, inbox-subfolder etc.)
2) check out click-sensitive area of non-top-level folder twisty ([+]/[-], or [>][v] depending on OS/version) to expand/collapse a parent folder with subfolders

Actual result
- no added sensitive margin to the *left* of twisty
- clicking only slightly to the *left* of twisty will select folder instead of expanding/collapsing it (which is nonsense because nobody will try to select a folder that way while you can just click on the folder name as a much bigger click target)

Expected result
- minimal fix: add few px of sensitive margin to the *left* of twisty
- better fix: enlarge sensitive area of twisty to the left (up to left window frame), so that it's a rectangle from left window frame up to and including twisty.","Yeah, this is odd indeed, and should be confirmed if it's not a dupe.","bugzilla2007","NULL","0",NULL,"0","0","0","0","0"

Amazing, and that behaviour is also entirely focus-ignorant (buggy), because while dotted focus border after Ctrl+double-click will be on second folder, first folder is still shown in message list (which makes it viable as a workaround for this bug).","(In reply to Juergen from comment #3)

My bad, sorry.

I'm unable to reproduce this with a 10-based release on Windows 7 but see it on Linux, both with the official OpenSUSE build as well as with 11b1 and 11b3 64-bit builds. I don't see it in a recent 13.0 nightly Linux build. Thus, it's apparently specific to Linux but unspecific to OpenSUSE, also similar to bug 713814 it is no longer visible on trunk.

I'm unable to reproduce this with a 10-based release on Windows 7 but see it on Linux, both with the official OpenSUSE build as well as with 11b1 and 11b3 64-bit builds. I don't see it in a recent 13.0 nightly Linux build. Thus, it's apparently specific to Linux but unspecific to OpenSUSE, also similar to bug 713814 it is no longer visible on trunk.

Confusing, but likely something happening in the Core backend which makes those issues come and go. Nevertheless, it would be nice to figure out what's going on...","I don't see it in a recent 13.0 nightly Linux build.","rsx11m.pub","squibblyflabbetydoo","1","issue","1","0","0","0","0"

Here is the example.

In this case, since there was a name in the recipient, only the recipients' names got single quotes, but there are cases in which if only e-mail addresses are used, they are the ones who got the single quotes.

Also, have in mind that some foreign names have a single quote, so the fix would be to find in the first+last character of the contact.

And for those of us who dislike (I'm trying to be kind, or I would use a much stronger word here) tabs in Thunderbird? Please tell me you guys will give us a choice of composing new messages in a new window rather than in a tab? Even most Webmail clients have this as an option.

I understand that this is a possibility, and I'm open to it, depending on how it is done.  However, I think the File, Edit, Tools, and Help menus should probably left as global (leaving Go, Message, [Events and Tasks] as possibly contextual).

At the moment, it is my understanding that the menu bar is only moved on Windows 7 (Aero), and that this was done to improve readability.  I think readability on Aero should be addressed in a different way for now (ie semi-transparent background-color like Firefox uses), until contextual menus are implemented and the menu bar changes, moves, or goes away for everyone.","(In reply to Siddharth Agarwal [:sid0] from comment #5)

Yes, I'm pretty sure that isn't going to change, especially since we let people read mail inside a new tab.

No, not yet (outside of an informal discussion between bwinton and me about UX), since this isn't being actively worked on. It's been proposed as a project for this Google Summer of Code though.

I think this works as designed. Mailing lists are just set of addresses so you can send a message to a group of people. When you move an address book entry to the mailing list, this entry is copied, not moved.

Typically you enter names directly into the mailing list, which creates new entries in the list, but you can also drag onto the list, which creates a copy.

Yes and no. AFAIK it is generally up to the process that placed the icon in the tray to remove it. I don't think the Windows OS takes care of it automatically. If a program terminates abnormally in Windows the tray may not refresh to reflect that the program has closed (because the process aborted without executing any instruction to remove the tray icon).","(In reply to sjw from comment #10)

"1839","2837","572","Hi Khoem, I've ran compare-locales on http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-beta/km and found that not all strings are translated. For km to be part of Thunderbird 38 (which is in beta), you'd should translate these strings and push them to the mozilla-beta repository. It also seems that beta is only 81% translated, but you mention 99% ? Its common for translations to be in the 90's somewhere (96% is the current highscore) because some strings are used as settings and can remain untranslated, but as you have 81% I'd suggest bringing this up to 90%.

If the process is different than it was for Firefox please let me know the differences (and maybe link me to the bug where you got it added for Firefox), this is the first time I am reviewing a locale for inclusion myself.

For km to be part of Thunderbird 38 (which is in beta), you'd should translate these strings and push them to the mozilla-beta repository. It also seems that beta is only 81% translated, but you mention 99% ? Its common for translations to be in the 90's somewhere (96% is the current highscore) because some strings are used as settings and can remain untranslated, but as you have 81% I'd suggest bringing this up to 90%.

If the process is different than it was for Firefox please let me know the differences (and maybe link me to the bug where you got it added for Firefox), this is the first time I am reviewing a locale for inclusion myself.

"1848","2839","572","Ah yes, mozilla.locamotion.org handles translations on aurora. I am happy to check again for aurora and add it there, in that case it can be part of Thunderbird 39.0b1 and up. If you would like to make km part of the current beta (38.0b5), then you will have to manually transplant the relevant changes from the aurora to beta repository. Its not as comfortable as mozilla.locamotion.org unfortunately, but there is afaik no other way to get it into the current beta. We'd need to have this done by Thursday, earlier is better.

If you are fine with 39.0b1 and up thats fine with me too. Note the next full Thunderbird release after Thunderbird 38 will be Thunderbird 45, everything inbetween is just betas.

If you would like to make km part of the current beta (38.0b5), then you will have to manually transplant the relevant changes from the aurora to beta repository. Its not as comfortable as mozilla.locamotion.org unfortunately, but there is afaik no other way to get it into the current beta. We'd need to have this done by Thursday, earlier is better.

I was just looking at old bugs and see that we haven't actually completed the work here. Sorry about that!

Looking at pontoon, it seems you have 93% Thunderbird translated. Including the Toolkit strings (running compare-locales), it is 74% total translation. Looking at the missing strings there are a lot in areas not so important for Thunderbird (e.g. devtools), so I am willing to add this to nightly all-locales.

The nightly builds are currently broken due to bug 1396563, but this should be fixed soon. 

Are you still interested in maintaining the translation? If so, the attached patch will get the nightly builds running. Once you have translated most of the immediately user-visible strings and are happy with the quality, you can file a new bug to get your language added to the betas. 

I've also update the region properties file in https://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/km/rev/79239374c86f6a94db6e26c8f0a85f75b2ecec30","Created attachment 8916295

The nightly builds are currently broken due to bug 1396563, but this should be fixed soon. 

Are you still interested in maintaining the translation? If so, the attached patch will get the nightly builds running. Once you have translated most of the immediately user-visible strings and are happy with the quality, you can file a new bug to get your language added to the betas. 

I've also update the region properties file in https://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/km/rev/79239374c86f6a94db6e26c8f0a85f75b2ecec30","Once you have translated most of the immediately user-visible strings and are happy with the quality, you can file a new bug to get your language added to the betas.","philipp","NULL","1","con","0","0","0","1","0"

I was just looking at old bugs and see that we haven't actually completed the work here. Sorry about that!

It's well known that we have issues with the progress bar. So it's far more likely  the progress bar firing when it shouldn't, implying something happening when there is not rather than the AM missing some activity.","(In reply to Mitra Ardron from comment #8)

Probably best filed as seperate bug reports. And morph this bug to a specific example of what you consider to be the most important issue.

This shows a message with a couple of Gmail labels - 'Important' and 'Software Development/Thunderbird'. If you click on the 'X' next to either of these, that label will be removed from the message.

Everything else that follows does not pertain directly to this bug, but I am including it just for a complete explanation of the Gmail Buttons extension:

The 'Spam' button is a shortcut for 'move message to [Gmail]/Spam folder'. Likewise, 'Trash' button is shortcut for 'move message to [Gmail]/Trash folder'. 

In the account settings, the delete model is set to 'Just mark as deleted', so the 'Delete' button (hidden) does not move messages to [Gmail]/Trash, which is why there is a new 'Trash' button.","Created attachment 670835

Although like squib I also do a lot of function overrides yet have not experienced any issues, I do wonder what we gain by leaving it at default if it will break some extensions.

So the proposal we could consider would be to flip this extension to the old value for TB 45 only, but leave it to the new value for TB 46 and later. Are there any downsides to doing that?

I did some more test and it appears that the bug does NOT manifest
when I reply to messages from sent on or prior to 4/10/12
at 9:48 am, and always when I reply to messages from Dan sent on or
after 4/10/12 at 11:32 am.  I contacted my IT dept and they are unable to
determine what local IT change may have happened at that time.

Reply-all to the same messages using Exchange's OWA web client work properly and reply-all to other messages from others works properly too.

When I move an offending message from my organization's Exchange 2010 server to my Gmail inbox via IMAP drag and drop, reply-all works correctly.  When I drag it back to my Exchange 2010 inbox, it resumes the failure modes described above.

Not exactly. I see 2 differences:
1. I do not see 'Recipients' appearing. Folder list is reset to some default view, but there is no 'Recipients' there. That default has coluemns 'Thread', 'Star', 'Subject', 'Read', 'From', Junk Status', 'Date' in that order. And there is 'Attachment' column somewhere near the beginning of list in the default view.

2. For me it happens after Addon update (may be after TB update as well, but it seldom happens without addon update in the same restart), not reandomly.

As I found just now, it also happens after 'repair folder' on INBOX, but the 'Attachment' column is not reset to its default position somewhere in the beginning of columns, as happens after TB restart.

I have INBOX.msf files: INBOX.1.msf is copied immediately after first TB restart (after addon install), when the order of columns is TB default, not mine. Next (INBOX.2.msf) when I changed mail folder forth and back and thus restored column order and the third (INBOX.2.msf) I took after another one restart of TB, just in case.

I have INBOX.msf files: INBOX.1.msf is copied immediately after first TB restart (after addon install), when the order of columns is TB default, not mine. Next (INBOX.2.msf) when I changed mail folder forth and back and thus restored column order and the third (INBOX.2.msf) I took after another one restart of TB, just in case.
But I do not know how to extract column order info from msf files. They are quite large (more than 6MB each), but heir difference is small.

I have INBOX.msf files: INBOX.1.msf is copied immediately after first TB restart (after addon install), when the order of columns is TB default, not mine. Next (INBOX.2.msf) when I changed mail folder forth and back and thus restored column order and the third (INBOX.2.msf) I took after another one restart of TB, just in case.
But I do not know how to extract column order info from msf files. They are quite large (more than 6MB each), but heir difference is small.

To further prove the theory, please:
- remove ALL addons (remove, not just disable)
- restart

"2202","5749","1079","Hi Wayne,

I have many recurring events, but it seems to be rather related to input boxes (I experience this in all thunderbird input boxes).

I tried 'turning off' the two synced calendars (by clearing the checkbox next to them in the calendar window) and then restarting thunderbird; and I still have the text input lag.

If you think just turning off the checkboxes like I did is not sufficient to disable the calendar, please let me know and I'll try to disable the calendar more thoroughly.

On the issue itself: My best indication whether I have this issue going on (since the sluggishness in typing is not always that easily quantifyable - you just feel it): just type a long sentence, hold the backspace key to erase part, and stop holding it. The cursor goes back, pauses, and goes back one more character after I've released the backspace key. Plus it's difficult to predict where the cursor will stop (while I'm trained to more or less predict how long I have to hold the backspace key in a text box behaving normally).

Found the switch for Hardware Accelerations, turned it on, restarted thunderbird - lag was back. So this was the culprit.","The release

Same observations here: After upgrade to 38.2.0 the issue is gone. Explicitly switching on hardware acceleration brings it back.

I now remember that I had a very similar issue with Chrome on the same laptop (ThinkPad T500 with ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3650 graphics card):

This has been tested with other clients (Outlook, OSX Mail and the server direct webmail interface) with the same accounts. These never add the x-sender to the header. Further none of the other accounts in Thunderbird that go through the same mail server that use the exact same account settings except for username and password have ever had this problem. The email server does not insert this information and it is not inserted on the recipient end as this occurs when inter office mailing as well and only isolated to the couple of accounts identified so far.

The affected accounts add an incorrect x-sender address 100% of the time in Thunderbird and 0% from any other mail client.

We have also tested this to outside recipient addresses such as gmail and see the same issue there so it is not isolated to just same server mail.","This (In reply to Ian Neal from comment #10)

If the problem is in your settings which are stored in the prefs.js file, then reinstalling will not have any effect. You would have to remove also the profile/settings but then you would have to set up all accounts again and also properly point them to the data files of already downloaded messages. Please do not do it unless really necessary. We'd also like to know what was the problem so do not remove all traces by wiping the profile.","(In reply to bigtom from comment #13)

So my theory here is that you try to send mail, you authenticate to the SMTP server as user@wrong.com. The auth passes and then you supply the server a message to send with a header 'From: user@send.com'. So the server adds the X-Sender header with the username you provided in the authentication, so that the recipient sees the 2 addresses differ (may be a spam attempt). Or it adds the header in all cases.

So my theory here is that you try to send mail, you authenticate to the SMTP server as user@wrong.com. The auth passes and then you supply the server a message to send with a header 'From: user@send.com'. So the server adds the X-Sender header with the username you provided in the authentication, so that the recipient sees the 2 addresses differ (may be a spam attempt). Or it adds the header in all cases.

With respect to your assumption on no changes during the last 8 years, I would refer to the release notes further up, stating that Gmail wasn't synchronized properly before. So the non-sync on kubuntu 14.04 could well have been a result of the non-functional Gmail sync. Though this can only be a guess on my side. 

I have added a screenshot of the settings. You can see the 3 new mails, read in Inbox but not yet synced.

You might want to suggest I create a new profile. It is well possible that that will work. But it is a non-solution. Any reasonable software will have to re-read its configuration and behave accordingly. If it doesn't, something must be flawy in its logic and sequence.

Privacy:

One thing we'd like to do is auto-complete as many fields as possible for the user when the order form is loaded. This would likely be fields for an email address and a name.

Instead of passing those values to the service for *them* to pre-populate the form with, would it be preferable for us to attempt to pre-populate the fields on the client-side?

Or can we assume that if the user has decided to sign up for the service, that they're OK sending that information?

Security:

With the current proposal, we'd be receiving and interpreting a JSON string from our third-party partners, and using it to tweak prefs at the chrome-level.  Does that sound kosher?

Yes.  We should let the user see and correct the data before submitting them to the server.

I don't think we should make assumptions, especially about peoples' willingness to share their email, name, etc.  While the users may have consciously decided to sign up, they may not have thought through what information is required to register.","(In reply to Mike Conley (:mconley) from comment #8)

What I can tell about bug 910287 is that the failure happened only if compose window is recycled before the test. (In the failure case, the recycled window is come from test-save-changes-on-quit.js.)

What I can tell about bug 910287 is that the failure happened only if compose window is recycled before the test. (In the failure case, the recycled window is come from test-save-changes-on-quit.js.) So there might be some room for improvement in composition codes too.","So there might be some room for improvement in composition codes too.","hikezoe","ishikawa","0",NULL,"0","0","0","0","0"

Placing wait_for_message_display_completion() in strategic places. add-wait-after-click-row.patch [WITHOUT MAGICAL TIMEOUTs!]

This patch REMOVES the MAGICAL TIMEOUTs.

On my PC, only two test failures from the account test(s) and
one from instrument remain as I noted in my previous comment.

The logic of waiting for proper message display (using wait_for_message_display_completion() ) after a selected row is

One line fix (Work in Progress) that works rather well.

This is a work-in-progress patch.
I looked inside select_click_row(), for which I thought was
inserting a wait after the change for a display to show up.

I was surprised to find that there *is* already a wait
within select_click_row(). Then why was not the wait be effective?

I found after a lot of trials and errors,  the
conditional-expression in if() seems to be wrong.

Please see the work-in-progress attached.

I took out the previous patch and used this modified
patch that invokes the wait routine INSIDE select_click_row() based
on hasMessageDisplay.

|make mozmill| runs as successfully as with the previous patch now.

If I am on the right track, I can clean up the WIP patch to a one line change.

After reading that you do not think the conditions of plan_for_message_display and wait_for_message_display_completion are wrong, I ran |make mozmill| on my local PCs.

Something has improved the timeout issues WITHOUT my patch on 32-bit Debian GNU/Linux.

The 'one-line' change in the whole patch, quoted below, makes (or
made) a great difference on my machine, or so I thought 
(please read on).  It may not be easy to see this change is taking place due
to the inclusion of sanity-check block.

-  if (willDisplayMessage)
+  if (hasMessageDisplay)	// was willDisplayMessage

(A few paragraphs below is my observation until today)

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight
without errors on my 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux PC.

(log1003-mozmill.txt is the session log of |make mozmill| run six
times and captured by script command.)

grep ^INFO log1003-mozmill.txt | grep Passed: | grep Directories
INFO | (runtestlist.py) | Directories Run: 35, Passed: 1089, Failed: 0
INFO | (runtestlist.py) | Directories Run: 35, Passed: 1089, Failed: 0

INFO | (runtestlist.py) | Directories Run: 35, Passed: 1089, Failed: 0


And each run, due to the change of one line, We call
plan_for_message_display 110 times more than we did without the patch.
(The following line is printed from the rest of the patch in the
sanity-check block to see how TB is behaving differently with the
patch. It was printed 100 times. The count 110 is added by the summary
script.)

    110 WARNING: (debug) we are calling plan_for_message_display(). we did not before.

Two weeks ago or so, whereas, WITHOUT the patch, |make mozmill| could NOT
run without producing erros most of the time.

***********
*** BUT ***
***********

today, I found out that something changed in TB between the time I
reported the original finding, patch, etc. and today.

On 32-bit GNU/Debian Linux, WITHOUT my patch, |make mozmill| run
straight without producing errors!!!

A pleasant surprise.

(I checked the |hg log| output, and maybe your patch

summary:     Bug 910287 - Ensure that eml message is displayed to avoid intermittent test failure. r=Standard8

solved underlying issues?)

On the other hand, on 64-bit GNU/Debian Linux,
the bug certainly appears still WITHOUT my patch.
(But maybe I should check if the 64-bit environment has the latest
parch of yours.)

I will quote the errors that are still experienced in 64-bit
environment later today, hopefully.

Just a side note: I realize that maybe a tryserver environment and my
environment has differences, which may affect the outcome of |make
mozmill| adversely on my local PC. 
(This in itself is not desirable to test TB as multi-platform mail
client IMHO.)

Like, for example, the switch to Ubuntu on TryServer seems to have
caused some unexpected test failures (?):
Bug 910281, bug 910286, bug 910287, mentioned in
the releasenote of thunderbird 25.0 beta
http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that

     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

After reading that you do not think the conditions of plan_for_message_display and wait_for_message_display_completion are wrong, I ran |make mozmill| on my local PCs.

Something has improved the timeout issues WITHOUT my patch on 32-bit Debian GNU/Linux.

The 'one-line' change in the whole patch, quoted below, makes (or
made) a great difference on my machine, or so I thought 
(please read on).  It may not be easy to see this change is taking place due
to the inclusion of sanity-check block.

-  if (willDisplayMessage)
+  if (hasMessageDisplay)	// was willDisplayMessage

(A few paragraphs below is my observation until today)

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight
without errors on my 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux PC.

(log1003-mozmill.txt is the session log of |make mozmill| run six
times and captured by script command.)

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

solved underlying issues?)

On the other hand, on 64-bit GNU/Debian Linux,
the bug certainly appears still WITHOUT my patch.
(But maybe I should check if the 64-bit environment has the latest
parch of yours.)

I will quote the errors that are still experienced in 64-bit
environment later today, hopefully.

Just a side note: I realize that maybe a tryserver environment and my
environment has differences, which may affect the outcome of |make
mozmill| adversely on my local PC. 
(This in itself is not desirable to test TB as multi-platform mail
client IMHO.)

Like, for example, the switch to Ubuntu on TryServer seems to have
caused some unexpected test failures (?):
Bug 910281, bug 910286, bug 910287, mentioned in
the releasenote of thunderbird 25.0 beta
http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

I will report what I find on 64-bit version later today or tomorrow at the latest hopefully.","(The following line is printed from the rest of the patch in the

After reading that you do not think the conditions of plan_for_message_display and wait_for_message_display_completion are wrong, I ran |make mozmill| on my local PCs.

Something has improved the timeout issues WITHOUT my patch on 32-bit Debian GNU/Linux.

The 'one-line' change in the whole patch, quoted below, makes (or

(A few paragraphs below is my observation until today)

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight
without errors on my 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux PC.

(log1003-mozmill.txt is the session log of |make mozmill| run six
times and captured by script command.)

And each run, due to the change of one line, We call

(The following line is printed from the rest of the patch in the

today, I found out that something changed in TB between the time I
reported the original finding, patch, etc. and today.

On 32-bit GNU/Debian Linux, WITHOUT my patch, |make mozmill| run
straight without producing errors!!!

A pleasant surprise.

On the other hand, on 64-bit GNU/Debian Linux,
the bug certainly appears still WITHOUT my patch.
(But maybe I should check if the 64-bit environment has the latest
parch of yours.)

I will quote the errors that are still experienced in 64-bit
environment later today, hopefully.

Just a side note: I realize that maybe a tryserver environment and my
environment has differences, which may affect the outcome of |make
mozmill| adversely on my local PC. 
(This in itself is not desirable to test TB as multi-platform mail
client IMHO.)

Like, for example, the switch to Ubuntu on TryServer seems to have
caused some unexpected test failures (?):
Bug 910281, bug 910286, bug 910287, mentioned in
the releasenote of thunderbird 25.0 beta
http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

After reading that you do not think the conditions of plan_for_message_display and wait_for_message_display_completion are wrong, I ran |make mozmill| on my local PCs.

Something has improved the timeout issues WITHOUT my patch on 32-bit Debian GNU/Linux.

The 'one-line' change in the whole patch, quoted below, makes (or
made) a great difference on my machine, or so I thought 
(please read on).  It may not be easy to see this change is taking place due
to the inclusion of sanity-check block.

-  if (willDisplayMessage)
+  if (hasMessageDisplay)	// was willDisplayMessage

(A few paragraphs below is my observation until today)

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight
without errors on my 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux PC.

(log1003-mozmill.txt is the session log of |make mozmill| run six
times and captured by script command.)

And each run, due to the change of one line, We call
plan_for_message_display 110 times more than we did without the patch.
(The following line is printed from the rest of the patch in the
sanity-check block to see how TB is behaving differently with the
patch. It was printed 100 times. The count 110 is added by the summary
script.)

    110 WARNING: (debug) we are calling plan_for_message_display(). we did not before.

Two weeks ago or so, whereas, WITHOUT the patch, |make mozmill| could NOT
run without producing erros most of the time.

the releasenote of thunderbird 25.0 beta
http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

On the other hand, on 64-bit GNU/Debian Linux,

I will quote the errors that are still experienced in 64-bit

Just a side note: I realize that maybe a tryserver environment and my
environment has differences, which may affect the outcome of |make

Bug 910281, bug 910286, bug 910287, mentioned in
the releasenote of thunderbird 25.0 beta
http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

(A few paragraphs below is my observation until today)

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight
without errors on my 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux PC.

(log1003-mozmill.txt is the session log of |make mozmill| run six
times and captured by script command.)

http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.

    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test

I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still

After reading that you do not think the conditions of plan_for_message_display and wait_for_message_display_completion are wrong, I ran |make mozmill| on my local PCs.

Something has improved the timeout issues WITHOUT my patch on 32-bit Debian GNU/Linux.

The 'one-line' change in the whole patch, quoted below, makes (or
made) a great difference on my machine, or so I thought 
(please read on).  It may not be easy to see this change is taking place due
to the inclusion of sanity-check block.

-  if (willDisplayMessage)
+  if (hasMessageDisplay)	// was willDisplayMessage

(A few paragraphs below is my observation until today)

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight
without errors on my 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux PC.

(log1003-mozmill.txt is the session log of |make mozmill| run six
times and captured by script command.)

And each run, due to the change of one line, We call
plan_for_message_display 110 times more than we did without the patch.
(The following line is printed from the rest of the patch in the

Bug 910281, bug 910286, bug 910287, mentioned in
the releasenote of thunderbird 25.0 beta
http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

After reading that you do not think the conditions of plan_for_message_display and wait_for_message_display_completion are wrong, I ran |make mozmill| on my local PCs.

Something has improved the timeout issues WITHOUT my patch on 32-bit Debian GNU/Linux.

The 'one-line' change in the whole patch, quoted below, makes (or
made) a great difference on my machine, or so I thought 
(please read on).  It may not be easy to see this change is taking place due
to the inclusion of sanity-check block.

-  if (willDisplayMessage)
+  if (hasMessageDisplay)	// was willDisplayMessage

(A few paragraphs below is my observation until today)

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight
without errors on my 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux PC.

(log1003-mozmill.txt is the session log of |make mozmill| run six
times and captured by script command.)

And each run, due to the change of one line, We call
plan_for_message_display 110 times more than we did without the patch.
(The following line is printed from the rest of the patch in the
sanity-check block to see how TB is behaving differently with the

Bug 910281, bug 910286, bug 910287, mentioned in
the releasenote of thunderbird 25.0 beta
http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Something has improved the timeout issues WITHOUT my patch on 32-bit Debian GNU/Linux.

The 'one-line' change in the whole patch, quoted below, makes (or

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight
without errors on my 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux PC.

times and captured by script command.)

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)

		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that

     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

the issues, here is my setup.

security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight

http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

After reading that you do not think the conditions of plan_for_message_display and wait_for_message_display_completion are wrong, I ran |make mozmill| on my local PCs.

Something has improved the timeout issues WITHOUT my patch on 32-bit Debian GNU/Linux.

The 'one-line' change in the whole patch, quoted below, makes (or
made) a great difference on my machine, or so I thought 
(please read on).  It may not be easy to see this change is taking place due
to the inclusion of sanity-check block.

-  if (willDisplayMessage)
+  if (hasMessageDisplay)	// was willDisplayMessage

(A few paragraphs below is my observation until today)

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight
without errors on my 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux PC.

(log1003-mozmill.txt is the session log of |make mozmill| run six
times and captured by script command.)

And each run, due to the change of one line, We call
plan_for_message_display 110 times more than we did without the patch.
(The following line is printed from the rest of the patch in the
sanity-check block to see how TB is behaving differently with the
patch. It was printed 100 times. The count 110 is added by the summary
script.)

Bug 910281, bug 910286, bug 910287, mentioned in
the releasenote of thunderbird 25.0 beta
http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

For example, with this patch, |make mozmill| can run six times straight

solved underlying issues?)

On the other hand, on 64-bit GNU/Debian Linux,
the bug certainly appears still WITHOUT my patch.
(But maybe I should check if the 64-bit environment has the latest
parch of yours.)

I will quote the errors that are still experienced in 64-bit
environment later today, hopefully.

Just a side note: I realize that maybe a tryserver environment and my
environment has differences, which may affect the outcome of |make
mozmill| adversely on my local PC. 
(This in itself is not desirable to test TB as multi-platform mail
client IMHO.)

Like, for example, the switch to Ubuntu on TryServer seems to have
caused some unexpected test failures (?):
Bug 910281, bug 910286, bug 910287, mentioned in
the releasenote of thunderbird 25.0 beta
http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/25.0beta/releasenotes/buglist.html

Ubuntu is derived from Debian. So maybe similar and additional issues
may pop up under Debian GNU/Linux.  I am not surprised if this were
the case since Debian often wants to use very stable versions of
various packages and incorporate only selected patches, mostly
security-related, into the components that are distributed using its
packaging system. (For example, I could not build TB for more than
half a year since its standard build tool chain, especially g++, could not
compile TB source files a couple of years ago. This was a pain in the neck.)

For your information, just in case, this becomes relevant in analyzing
the issues, here is my setup.

PC1: OS/Desktop: 32-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VirtualBox
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 [This is where I found out after running test
		 overnight that, local build of comm-central TB, does not produce 
		 timeout errors, even without my patch, anymore.]

PC2: OS/Desktop: 64-bits Debian GNU/Linux that runs inside VMplayer
		 (hosted on win7 64 bits)
		 I briefly checked and found that removing the patch
		 DID produce errors still. (But let me check if that
		 environment has your latest patch.changeset:   13121:516bfae38327)
		 
     Both Debian distribution now use the testing repository as well as
     the current standard repository since gcc-4.8 was not available
     in the standard repository a couple of months ago, and I wanted
     to use gcc-4.8 for improved -gsplit-dwarf option.

Used Display Resolution? : 1280x768

    I use Xephyr as the target window for the local
    |make mozmill| test of thunderbird.
    I use xfwm4 within the Xephyr environment.
    # Use a separate window as Xserver screen.
    Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1280x768 :1 &
    DISPLAY=localhost:1.0
    sleep 2
    oclock &
    xfwm4 &

    This DISPLAY variable is exported and |make mozmill| is executed.
    I don't think use of xfwm4 should affect the TB behavior as far as 
    I can tell. And TB should not be affected much by the choice of window
    manager IMHO.

[Curious] What about TryServer

OS/Desktop: Ubuntu(?) GNU/Linux (switched from Fedora recently?)

Display Resolution?
	Not sure how the display is handled on TryServer at all.
	Come to think of it, how is it done?

What is the window manager???

Anyway, to sum up, to my pleasant surprise, on 32-bit environment
where TB is officially supported, TB does not produce the timeout errors
even without my supposed patch as of today. This is a great news indeed.
(I have applied my patch for the last few weeks, since it was necessary to cover as many test
as possible so did not realize that I no
longer need this patch any more.)

As for 64-bit, let me check the details, especially the
patch state, again.
I will report what errors caused the timeout errors if they still
persist. Since 64-bit TB is not officially supported, it may be a moot issue,
but if we can get down to the true cause of the issues, we may glean
something useful.

Thank you again for your time and review.

Errors still encountered under 64-bit Debian GNU/Linux (without the patch and the patch from Oct 4th).

I checked the 64-bit environment, and it had the patch of yours 
Dated Oct 4th :-(
It still shows errors that are no longer visible under 32-bit without the posted patch. 

I take the following from a log |make mozmill| without the patch under
64-bit Debian GNU/Linux of running 64-bit TB (locally built from comm-central source).

-  running |make mozmill| once,

     Part-I is the excerpts from the session log where the error is

     Part-II is the excerpts from the summary after each test run.

-  running |make mozmill| twice

     Part-III is the excerpts from the summary of the run.

There are obviously repetitions. And these are not exhaustive, I am
afraid, but since 32-bit test under 32-bit environment does not show
the errors, maybe the first few errors mentioned here will guide us
whether the investigation under 64-bit is warranted or not.
(Very strange that my patch magically eliminates these errors.
From what I found, maybe accessing the data structure within
sanity-check block, and the miniscule time spent there may have
caused the enough delay in multi-threaded environment to make the following
tests not to fail(?).

Well, hmm, I just want to use TB as a dependable mail client, but I am afraid

OK, in this sense, I do think the if conditions in the two statements must match since I read
somewhere in the JS code that these calls must be paired. Hiro, do you think that is not the case?
I am somewhat surprised that my fix would have called plan_for_message_display()
100+ more times than the unpatched case, and this seemed to be a source of potential problems.
(Yes, it may not manifest most of the time, but at least it does make a difference on 64-bit 
environment. It is hard to tell. It seems to be related to thread-races.)

Thank you for valuable hint and tipos.
I will investigate focus manager. 
Well, hmm, I just want to use TB as a dependable mail client, but I am afraid 
I am being sucked into never-ending bug hunt !?

OK, in this sense, I do think the if conditions in the two statements must match since I read
somewhere in the JS code that these calls must be paired. Hiro, do you think that is not the case?
I am somewhat surprised that my fix would have called plan_for_message_display()
100+ more times than the unpatched case, and this seemed to be a source of potential problems.
(Yes, it may not manifest most of the time, but at least it does make a difference on 64-bit 
environment. It is hard to tell. It seems to be related to thread-races.)

"2753","572","99","One principle problem is that it's duplicated functionality for no good reason.

The cause for the frustation is that the button to switch from the new wizard to the old config screen doesn't work, it's greyed out, and it's neither obvious how to get it activated, nor is it usually quick and easy to achieve that. It's frustrating if you know that you could configure it in seconds in the old config screen, if you only would find a way to get there.

If you try with a non-existing server, or in offline-mode, you can just fill all fields with anything, until the button finally becomes active. But if the server exists and you are online, and you enter correct info, then the new wizard is picky about what input it accepts. For some email accounts it works great and is a fast and super easy way to configure an account, but for others it's necessary to get somehow to the full config screen, and it's difficult and time-consuming to get there, you'll have to wait until the wizard times out or gives up. Or you must know how to cheat it by entering a non existing server or go to offline mode.

Also once an account is configured, there's no way to get back to the wizard. In this case only the old config screen is available. But as long as an account is not configured, only the new wizard is accesible. This is inconsistent and unneccesarily difficult to use.

It's frustrating if you know that you could configure it in seconds in the old config screen, if you only would find a way to get there.

If you try with a non-existing server, or in offline-mode, you can just fill all fields with anything, until the button finally becomes active. But if the server exists and you are online, and you enter correct info, then the new wizard is picky about what input it accepts. For some email accounts it works great and is a fast and super easy way to configure an account, but for others it's necessary to get somehow to the full config screen, and it's difficult and time-consuming to get there, you'll have to wait until the wizard times out or gives up. Or you must know how to cheat it by entering a non existing server or go to offline mode.

Also once an account is configured, there's no way to get back to the wizard. In this case only the old config screen is available. But as long as an account is not configured, only the new wizard is accesible. This is inconsistent and unneccesarily difficult to use.

I tested on 45.1.0 and yes I can reproduce the issue, and also came to the same conclusion that it's the formatting routines that likely have to do an insane amount of work for a machine-encoded file like this.

This code doesn't look like it's multi-threaded, only one core has to do the work, apparently blocking the UI thread.

In HTML mode (my default), the EML displayed instantly.

Switching to Plain Text mode, it took TB upwards of 20+ seconds to display the formatted text.","I just opened(In reply to abittner from comment #12)

  a) Don't dispatch drag events with the test's copy of the DataTransfer, instead use dataTransfer.mozCloneForEvent() to make a copy of the DataTransfer to dispatch into that event.
  b) Collect the DataTransfer which the test helpers use within on-datatransfer-available, and use mozCloneForEvent to make a copy (as it will be cleared soon after). `drop` is IIRC what I use in my test helper.
  c) Copy over the drop effect when cloning - for annoying/complex reasons we don't copy it over by default.

The first thing I'm noticing is that you don't seem to copy the DataTransfer when dispatching other events than dragstart, which might be causing you problems.

In my mind, I'd do something along the lines of implementing what Firefox has for the view -> source, except without the syntax highlighting. Then again, I'm not familiar with how Thunderbird is coded, so I'm not quite sure how complicated it would be.

Another thing here is, if it would be necessary to show line numbers for email source.","(In reply to Jim Porter (:squib) from comment #20)

"3032","8110","1611","Possibilities:
- Streaming message bodies is leaking memory for some reason.  An extension or plugin?  I realize safe mode was used, so this probably shouldn't be happening.  Also, for something like enigmail which does get involved in streaming, I don't think we'd see it.

- Gloda is running way too fast.  Maybe a regression in the timing code that tells us how much work we are doing?  This would be a little surprising since we moved that code into TB from platform, so there should be no platform surprises.

Hm, OK. Maybe take this opportunity to double-check, because I could believe that the EDS Integration add-on is bogging you down.

Once we get TB symbols in the symbol server, a profile would (hopefully) help narrow this down.","(In reply to danieleds0 from comment #20)
