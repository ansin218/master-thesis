259,50332,4921,"OK, so ignoring the whole Boundary Box story and looking deeper into the code with my test case I noticed that a different bestFit value was being determined by the CartesianTierPlotter. 
I get a value of 13 for the test that passes (radius 32miles) and 14 when the test fails with a search radius of 31.  This means to me that we end up searching in the wrong tier. 
Looking at CartesianTierPlotter.bestFit() I see on the  line below the passed in value of miles is divided by 2.
>>> double r = miles / 2.0; 
I'm guessing r is meant to be a radius - but the miles parameter is already a radius  - of my search circle.
This has an effect on the calculation of the best fix box width - aka corner in the code - and the resulting bestFit or tierId.
If I change this to not divide by 2 - my issue test case passes - as do all my other tests.
Again I'd appreciate if someone who knows the code could comment and confirm my finding or tell my I'm crazy!

266,50332,4921,"OK, so ignoring the whole Boundary Box story and looking deeper into the code with my test case I noticed that a different bestFit value was being determined by the CartesianTierPlotter. 
I get a value of 13 for the test that passes (radius 32miles) and 14 when the test fails with a search radius of 31.  This means to me that we end up searching in the wrong tier. 
Looking at CartesianTierPlotter.bestFit() I see on the  line below the passed in value of miles is divided by 2.
>>> double r = miles / 2.0; 
I'm guessing r is meant to be a radius - but the miles parameter is already a radius  - of my search circle.
This has an effect on the calculation of the best fix box width - aka corner in the code - and the resulting bestFit or tierId.

DTR:
	
Would it be simpler to make close() synchronized (just like IR.close())
Would it - again - be simpler to keep maintaining the ref-counts in the internal IR and just, in refresh, decRef as needed in the old one and incRef accordingly in the new one? This way we continue to delegate that logic to IR, and do not duplicate it.
Current patch removes the ensureOpen() check from getRefCount(). I think this is correct - in fact I needed that when debugging this. Perhaps should document about it in CHANGES entry.

The reason that I advocated changing FilterScorer and BoostedScorer is to allow some of my custom Query implementations to use a regular BooleanQuery for recall and optionally scoring while taking advantage of the actual Scorers used on a per document, per clause basis.
This has been working great across quite a few Lucene releases but failed when I upgraded to 4.9 due to the two regressions in behavior for Scorer.getChildren() as described in this ticket.
In this scenario, a BooleanQuery containing two TermQueries (one a miss and the other a hit) returns the following from BooleanWeight.scorer():

TermScorer (hit)



Calling getChildren() on this returns an empty list because the BoostedScorer just returns in.getChildren() and thus you are unable to navigate to the actual TermScorer in play.

411,19004,1904,"Thanks for taking the time to review my patch and comment on the approach.
The reason that I advocated changing FilterScorer and BoostedScorer is to allow some of my custom Query implementations to use a regular BooleanQuery for recall and optionally scoring while taking advantage of the actual Scorers used on a per document, per clause basis.
This has been working great across quite a few Lucene releases but failed when I upgraded to 4.9 due to the two regressions in behavior for Scorer.getChildren() as described in this ticket.
In this scenario, a BooleanQuery containing two TermQueries (one a miss and the other a hit) returns the following from BooleanWeight.scorer():

BoostedScorer
	
TermScorer (hit)



Calling getChildren() on this returns an empty list because the BoostedScorer just returns in.getChildren() and thus you are unable to navigate to the actual TermScorer in play. This would impact any classes that extend FilterScorer and don't override getChildren(). In other words, the current wiring does make the BoostedScorer transparent but with the disadvantage of hiding the actual scorer that performs the work.

545,46701,4600,"but constitutes an API backcompat break
Can abort() have a default impl in IndexOutput, such as close() followed by deleteFile() maybe? If so, then it won't break anything.
Anyway, I think we can make an exception in this case - only those who impl Directory and provide their own IndexOutput extension will be affected, which I think is a relatively low number of applications?
What do you think?
Would abort() on Directory fit better? E.g., it can abort all currently open and modified files, instead of the caller calling abort() on each IndexOutput? Are you thinking of a case where a write failed, and the caller would call abort() immediately, instead of some higher-level code? If so, would rollback() be a better name?
I always thought of IndexOutput as a means for writing bytes, no special semantic logic coded and executed by it. The management code IMO should be maintained by higher-level code, such as Directory or even higher (today IndexWriter, but that's what you're trying to remove ).
So on one hand, I'd like to see IndexWriter's code simplified (this class has become a monster), but on the other, it doesn't feel right to me to add this logic in IndexOutput. Maybe I don't understand the use case for it well though. I do think though, that abort() on IndexOutput has a specific, clearer, meaning, where on Directory it can be perceived as kinda vague (what exactly is it aborting, reading / writing?). And maybe aborting a Directory is not good, if say you want to abort/rollback the changes done to a particular file.

It can't. To call deleteFile you need both a reference to papa-Directory and a name of the file this IO writes to. Abstract IO class has neither. If we add them, they have to be passed to a new constructor, and that's an API break 
Would abort() on Directory fit better? E.g., it can abort all currently open and modified files, instead of the caller calling abort() on each IndexOutput?

Oh, no, no. No way. I don't want to push someone else's responsibility on Directory. This abort() is merely a shortcut.

The reason why I came up with this issue is that I'm writing a selector in order to sort based on the values of a block of documents. To make it work efficiently I need to write a NumericDocValues instance that already returns the missing value when there are either no child documents in the block or if none of them have a value. So there is no need to check the missing values in the comparator.
I'm surprised that you think of it as a specialization as this is actually making things simpler? The handling of the missing value is done once for all in setNextReader and then the comparator only needs to care about the NumericDocValues instance. And it makes it easier (and potentially more efficient) to write selectors.","Uwe, please read the issue again: the goal was not to remove the null check, but the check for missing values.",jpountz,NULL,1,alternative,0,1,0,0,0

953,35722,3501,"Now you've got me thinking. Several points:
First, Jackson is far, far, less implementation-sensitive than the built-in Java serialization. It looks at the public API of constructors, getters, and setters. How likely are you to change the API in a way that invalidates the idea that a TermQuery consists of a term name and a value?
Second, this is not about long-term persistence. I'd be happy to document it as 'do not expect to move one of these across versions.' It's most obvious application is to move arbitrary queries around in SolrCloud.

TermQuery currently has a bogus constructor today:


/** Expert: constructs a TermQuery that will use the
  *  provided docFreq instead of looking up the docFreq
  *  against the searcher. */
public TermQuery(Term t, int docFreq) {


Its bogus because some scoring models may not use docFreq at all (e.g. language modelling): I know why it exists (for one contrib query), I think we have a plan to fix it, but its just not yet done... like many things 
But thats an example of one I think is fair to remove in a minor release: besides being bogus, its documented as Expert, 
so its fair game.
I'm just bringing this up as a counterexample... I thought serialization was harmless before myself
until I tried to make useful changes (like yanking vector-space model out of the scoring system) and was
totally blocked by serialization. So I'm gonna be suspicious of the word no matter what 

If it were up to me, I'd start by annotating the actually classes themselves with Jackson @nnotations for this purpose, and only create mixins when and if an incompatible change happened, but I'm not really opinionated.
Are these annotations in java 6 API? Annotations are no different than other pieces of code, they are an additional
responsibility. As far as @Deprecated, we fail the build if we add @deprecated javadocs but forget it, as far as
@Override, well nothing automated yet, but we should be somehow enforcing that as well. Besides the fact we don't
want to add any dependencies to the lucene core, how would we know such annotations were correct? 

Would it be sensible to start to concoct a contrib module with all the jackson in it, accompanied by benign 'add a few getters and setters' classes to the queries?
Don't let me get in your way: I'm just the devil's advocate when i hear serialization. As far as adding getters and setters
to queries I'm not sure if they are benign or not without us looking at them. For example, AutomatonQuery and all of its
subclasses: Wildcard, Regexp, etc are totally immutable once created. This is for good reasons so I don't think we should
add any setters to these classes, and the stuff it stores internally shouldn't be accessible via a getter.","

But thats an example of one I think is fair to remove in a minor release: besides being bogus, its documented as Expert, 
so its fair game.
I'm just bringing this up as a counterexample... I thought serialization was harmless before myself
until I tried to make useful changes (like yanking vector-space model out of the scoring system) and was
totally blocked by serialization. So I'm gonna be suspicious of the word no matter what 

If it were up to me, I'd start by annotating the actually classes themselves with Jackson @nnotations for this purpose, and only create mixins when and if an incompatible change happened, but I'm not really opinionated.
Are these annotations in java 6 API? Annotations are no different than other pieces of code, they are an additional
responsibility. As far as @Deprecated, we fail the build if we add @deprecated javadocs but forget it, as far as
@Override, well nothing automated yet, but we should be somehow enforcing that as well. Besides the fact we don't
want to add any dependencies to the lucene core, how would we know such annotations were correct? 

Would it be sensible to start to concoct a contrib module with all the jackson in it, accompanied by benign 'add a few getters and setters' classes to the queries?
Don't let me get in your way: I'm just the devil's advocate when i hear serialization. As far as adding getters and setters
to queries I'm not sure if they are benign or not without us looking at them. For example, AutomatonQuery and all of its
subclasses: Wildcard, Regexp, etc are totally immutable once created. This is for good reasons so I don't think we should
add any setters to these classes, and the stuff it stores internally shouldn't be accessible via a getter.","It looks at the public API of constructors, getters, and setters.",rcmuir,NULL,1,issue,1,0,0,0,0

until I tried to make useful changes (like yanking vector-space model out of the scoring system) and was
totally blocked by serialization. So I'm gonna be suspicious of the word no matter what 

If it were up to me, I'd start by annotating the actually classes themselves with Jackson @nnotations for this purpose, and only create mixins when and if an incompatible change happened, but I'm not really opinionated.
Are these annotations in java 6 API? Annotations are no different than other pieces of code, they are an additional
responsibility. As far as @Deprecated, we fail the build if we add @deprecated javadocs but forget it, as far as
@Override, well nothing automated yet, but we should be somehow enforcing that as well. Besides the fact we don't
want to add any dependencies to the lucene core, how would we know such annotations were correct? 

Would it be sensible to start to concoct a contrib module with all the jackson in it, accompanied by benign 'add a few getters and setters' classes to the queries?
Don't let me get in your way: I'm just the devil's advocate when i hear serialization. As far as adding getters and setters
to queries I'm not sure if they are benign or not without us looking at them. For example, AutomatonQuery and all of its
subclasses: Wildcard, Regexp, etc are totally immutable once created. This is for good reasons so I don't think we should
add any setters to these classes, and the stuff it stores internally shouldn't be accessible via a getter.","Would it be sensible to start to concoct a contrib module with all the jackson in it, accompanied by benign 'add a few getters and setters' classes to the queries?",rcmuir,NULL,0,NULL,0,0,0,0,0

First, Jackson is far, far, less implementation-sensitive than the built-in Java serialization. It looks at the public API of constructors, getters, and setters. How likely are you to change the API in a way that invalidates the idea that a TermQuery consists of a term name and a value?

different frameworks with different dependencies (e.g. xml depends on queries/ and sandbox/,

Basically what this means is that nothing seems to be inside anything else – and yet there are no edge intersections anywhere either.  I'm wondering if this is a result of granularity?  Theoretically, it is possible for a point that is not on the surface to be inside an XYZSolid and come up as inside the shape as well, even if there is no overlap between the solid and the surface shape, because the shape is described by planes that go through the center of the earth and are therefore not perpendicular to the XYZSolid's boundaries.
It does seem odd that all failures we've seen have been for very complex polygons, though.  I'll verify that all polygon edges that should be checked for intersection actually are being checked before resorting to that explanation.","Looking at the first failure, I have a simple unit test that demonstrates it, with some forensics in place:

Ahh, you're right ... I missed that.  OK.
The bug in the original code was that FilteredTermsEnum sets minSimilarity to 0 when the user-specified minSimilarity is >= 1.0f. So, in SlowFuzzyTermsEnum, similarity (unless it was Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) was typically > minSimilarity no matter its value. In other words, when the client code made the call with minSimilarity >=1.0f, that value was correctly recorded in maxEdits, but maxEdits wasn't the determining factor in whether SlowFuzzyTerms accepted a term.
Oh, I see: FuzzyTermsEnum does this in its ctor, and SlowFuzzyTermsEnum extends that.  Now I understand the bug ... thanks.

like if IndexInput takes String name in its ctor (the same one passed to Directory.openInput NOT the full path, keeps String as a private variable), and implements toString itself.
then we wouldnt have to track additional variables in each indexinput impl, only change openinput and the ctors to pass this information.
But i'm still not sure how useful this is. 
It really seems like an implementation detail that we check the stored fields to determine if an indexformat is too old. who cares what the file name is?","you might be able to work me down to a partial path rather than a full path...

We could assume 64-bit values and fall back to 32-bit if we encounter an exception, but I worry that we're getting a performance hit here for every 32-bit field.","There doesn't seem to be a good way of detecting this at uninvert-time from the FieldInfo data, though.",romseygeek,NULL,0,NULL,0,0,0,0,0

This assert in the test assertEquals(1, results.size()); is kinda moot because we always return a FacetResult, even if empty. Perhaps you can assert that if the acquired reader.maxDoc is > 0, the returned FacetResult.rootNode has at least one child with count that is at least 1?


Maybe change the end of the test to a single-line IOUtils.close()?


You wrote previously that the test uses LineFileDocs, but I don't see it. It seems it only adds facets to documents? If so, can it go back to newDirectory()?


It's good that you identify replaceTaxonomy, makes the code safer.


TR.getTaxoEpoch: maybe instead of adding it to TR you can use the one on DTW (make it public, @lucene.internal)? It's odd that it documents that this epoch is returned only for an NRT TR, because the epoch is recorded on the taxo index commit data, so conceptually there's no reason why it shouldn't always return it. Yet, since this epoch is used internally, between TW and TR, I prefer not to expose it too much. Hmmm, but then you may hit a false positive where the returned TR is valid, yet just in between the checks the app called replaceTaxo. But I think that's ok since it means the check will fail on the next refresh attempt. Really, if ever DTW.epoch changes, we should fail.


I don't know how important it is, but perhaps given the short discussion we had above, it would be good to add a 1-liner to decRef why the method seems unprotected, but in reality it's the best we can do?


In refreshIfNeeded, I understand this code newReader.decRef() is equivalent to closing newReader (if epoch has changed). But after I received a question yesterday from a someone who did not understand why we don't call close(), perhaps we should, for clarity?

This assert in the test assertEquals(1, results.size()); is kinda moot because we always return a FacetResult, even if empty. Perhaps you can assert that if the acquired reader.maxDoc is > 0, the returned FacetResult.rootNode has at least one child with count that is at least 1?

You wrote previously that the test uses LineFileDocs, but I don't see it. It seems it only adds facets to documents? If so, can it go back to newDirectory()?


It's good that you identify replaceTaxonomy, makes the code safer.


TR.getTaxoEpoch: maybe instead of adding it to TR you can use the one on DTW (make it public, @lucene.internal)? It's odd that it documents that this epoch is returned only for an NRT TR, because the epoch is recorded on the taxo index commit data, so conceptually there's no reason why it shouldn't always return it. Yet, since this epoch is used internally, between TW and TR, I prefer not to expose it too much. Hmmm, but then you may hit a false positive where the returned TR is valid, yet just in between the checks the app called replaceTaxo. But I think that's ok since it means the check will fail on the next refresh attempt. Really, if ever DTW.epoch changes, we should fail.

Yet, since this epoch is used internally, between TW and TR, I prefer not to expose it too much. Hmmm, but then you may hit a false positive where the returned TR is valid, yet just in between the checks the app called replaceTaxo. But I think that's ok since it means the check will fail on the next refresh attempt. Really, if ever DTW.epoch changes, we should fail.
I don't like that cutting over to DTW would open up the thread hazard
that we fail to catch the replace ... admittedly it'd be rare but why
open it up?  The added Expert/@lucene.internal method seems minor ...
When I worked on it in the past, DTR wasn't NRT and the sync was a nightmare. Making it NRT really simplified this manager!

1675,42714,4218,"sarowe asked about this issue in LUCENE-3587.
FWIW, i thought this issue (LUCENE-3228) had been resolved a long time ago based on some comments i remember people making, but evidently those comments where on irc/mail and folks didn't post them in Jira.
Problems with the patch i attached (that i know of):
1) we don't distribute dev-tools in our releases, so at a minimum we'd need to find a new home for any package-list files we wanted to ship.

1830,23914,2357,"First patch, 17 Oct 2013, quite rough, one nocommit.
The latest benchmark results for doc id sets are here: http://people.apache.org/~jpountz/doc_id_sets.html
The patch uses EliasFanoDocIdSet for caching when EliasFanoDocIdSet.sufficientlySmallerThanBitSet returns true,
which is currently when load factor is at most 1/7, at about -0.85 log10 scale in the benchmark results.
Otherwise it uses WAH8DocIdSet, the current behaviour.
Does this choice make good use of the benchmark results?
To get the number of doc ids to be put in the cache, the patch checks for the type of the actual DocIdSet that is given, and uses FixedBitSet and OpenBitSet cardinality. (Perhaps a similar method should be added to EliasFanoDocIdSet.)
In other cases, the patch falls back to WAH8DocIdSet.
I added a DocIdSet argument to cacheImpl(), there is a nocommit for that.
The patch also corrects a mistake in EliasFanoDocIdSet.sufficientlySmallerThanBitSet, the arguments should be int instead of long, just like the  EliasFanoDocIdSet constructor.

There is an EliasFanoEncoder2 with a constructor with only an upperBound.
This class delegates to EliasFanoEncoder and has very much the same methods, but not yet a common interface/superclass.
It works by growing by a factor of 2 as necessary, and reencoding completely.
This reencoding could be optimized for the lower bits by using PackedInts to block decode/encode, but I have not taken the time to implement that.
The EliasFanoDocIdSet has an extra constructor that takes only an upperbound that uses EliasFanoEncoder2.
I ran some tests on this, it appears to work fine here.
A possibly misplaced assert in TestEliasFanoDocIdSet is corrected to make the test pass.
CachingWrapperFilter uses the extra EliasFanoDocIdSet constructor when the number of doc ids in the set is not known,
and it reverts to FBS when this EliasFanoDocIdSet is not sufficiently smaller than an FBS.
For the rest see my comments on the patch of 18 Oct.
I also did a little bit of perfomance testing, the memory usage of the upperbound only constructor is higher, as expected.
The advance/next performance is only slightly less, again as expected.

The EliasFanoDocIdSet has an extra constructor that takes only an upperbound that uses EliasFanoEncoder2.
I ran some tests on this, it appears to work fine here.
A possibly misplaced assert in TestEliasFanoDocIdSet is corrected to make the test pass.
CachingWrapperFilter uses the extra EliasFanoDocIdSet constructor when the number of doc ids in the set is not known,
and it reverts to FBS when this EliasFanoDocIdSet is not sufficiently smaller than an FBS.
For the rest see my comments on the patch of 18 Oct.
I also did a little bit of perfomance testing, the memory usage of the upperbound only constructor is higher, as expected.
The advance/next performance is only slightly less, again as expected.

I don't like the 4-arg required param getXXX() methods in AbstractAnalysisFactory - 4th param as false means required??? - maybe these could be converted to getRequiredXXX() ?
I think AbstractAnalysisFactory could use additional param parsing methods:

get(args, param [, default]) would be a nice addition for strings, instead of args.remove(), which looks different from all the other getXXX() methods.  Maybe also a version that takes a set of acceptable values, as well as a boolean for case insensitivity?
getEnum(args, param, Enum class [, default] ) - probably case insensitivity could be assumed?
getChar() should be pulled out of PathHierarchyTokenizerFactory, so that DelimitedPayloadTokenFilterFactory can use it.
getFloat() - well, only one factory (NumericPayloadTokenFilterFactory) could use it now, but maybe add it for completeness?

A few nits:

TestMappingCharFilterFactory's factory could switch to being instantiated using the charFilterFactory() method
EdgeNgramTokenizerFactory's gram size constants are pulled from EdgeNgramTokenFilter instead of EdgeNgramTokenizer
LimitTokenCountFilterFactory's maxTokenCount param should be required; this is a pre-existing problem though
PatternTokenizerFactory's group param should use the getInt() method with a default of -1.

I don't like the 4-arg required param getXXX() methods in AbstractAnalysisFactory - 4th param as false means required??? - maybe these could be converted to getRequiredXXX() ?
I think AbstractAnalysisFactory could use additional param parsing methods:
    get(args, param [, default]) would be a nice addition for strings, instead of args.remove(), which looks different from all the other getXXX() methods. Maybe also a version that takes a set of acceptable values, as well as a boolean for case insensitivity?
    getEnum(args, param, Enum class [, default] ) - probably case insensitivity could be assumed?
    getChar() should be pulled out of PathHierarchyTokenizerFactory, so that DelimitedPayloadTokenFilterFactory can use it.

Brian Demers enabled o.a.lucene and o.a.solr in the Nexus repo (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-4497), and I successfully uploaded Lucene snapshot artifacts for 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT using Maven Ant Tasks.  I attempted to use an encrypted password in ~/.m2/settings.xml, but that failed, apparently because Maven Ant Tasks doesn't (yet) grok encrypted passwords (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MANTTASKS-177).  So I switched back to a plaintext password, but now I'm getting 401 errors from Nexus when I try to deploy Solr snapshots, or to re-deploy the Lucene snapshots.  I suspect Nexus has locked my account out (sarowe), but I'm not sure - can anybody here help?

2274,15837,1611,"I realize this issue is closed but it'd be sweet to have this kind of adaptive heuristic to throttle the number of merging threads as well. Let me explain.
When you think of it, the really important measurement of quality on the surface is I/O throughput of merges combined with I/O throughput of IW additions (indexing). Essentially we want to maximize a function:


f = merge_throughput + indexing_throughput


perhaps with a bias towards indexing_throughput which can be modeled (by multiplying by a constant?). The underlying variables to adaptively tune are:

how many merge threads there are (for example having too many doesn't make sense on a spindle, with an SSD this is not a problem),
when to pause/ resume existing merge threads,
when to pause/ resume indexing threads.

What's interesting is that we can tweak these variables in response to the the current value (and gradient) of function f. This means an adaptive algorithm could (examples):

react to temporary external system load (for example pausing some merge threads if it observes a drop in throughput),


find out the sweet spot of how many merge threads there can be without saturating I/O (no need to detect SSD vs. spindle; we just want to maximize f – the optimal number of merge threads would emerge by itself from looking at the data).

Now the big question is what this algorithm should look like, of course. The options vary from relatively simple hand-written rule-based heuristics to an advanced black-box with either pre-trained or adaptive machine learning algorithms.

Thanks for uploading this code Renaud, its great and the code is easy to work with. I hope to get some more of the codecs you wrote into the branch for testing.
I changed a few things that helped in benchmarking:

the decoder uses relative gets instead of absolute
we write #longs in the block header instead of #bytes (as its always long aligned, but smaller numbers)

But mainly, for this one I think we should change it to be a VariableIntBlock codec... right now it packs 128 integers into as few longs as possible, but this is wasteful for two reasons: it has to write a per-block byte header, and also wastes bits (e.g. in the case of a block of 128 1's).
With variableintblock, we could do this differently, e.g. read a fixed number of longs per-block (say 4 longs), and our block would then be variable between 4 and 240 integers depending upon data.",I pulled out the simple64 implementation here and adapted it to the bulkpostings branch.,rcmuir,NULL,1,decision,0,0,0,0,1

In the case of 240 1's, i was surprised to see this selector was used over 2\% of the time

in this case I am thinking about metadata fields and more structured data?
Yes, this makes sense. In the context of SIREn (kind of simple xml node based inverted index) which is meant for indexing semi-structured data, the difference was more observable (mainly on the frequency and position files, as well as other structure node files).
This might be also useful on the document id file for very common terms (maybe for certain type of facets, with a very few number of values covering a large portion of the document collection).","

The BulkVInt codec is VInt implemented as a FixedIntBlock codec.
Yes, I saw the code, it is a similar implementation of the VInt we used in our experiments.

previously various codecs
looked much faster than Vint but a lot of the reason for this is due to the way Vint
was implemented...
This is odd, because we observed the contrary (on the lucene-1458 branch). The standard codec was by an order of magnitude faster than any other codec. We discovered that this was due to the IntBlock interface implementation that:

was copying the buffer bytearray two times (one time from the disk to the buffer, then another time from the buffer to the IntBlock codec).
had to perform more work wrt to check each of the buffer (IntBlock buffer, IndexInput buffer).
But this might have been improved since then. Michael told me he worked on a new version of the IntBlock interface which was more performant.


So, if we 'group' the long values so we are e.g. reading say N long values
at once in a single internal 'block', I think we might get more efficiency
via the I/O system, and also less overhead from the bulkpostings apis.
If I understand, this is similar to increasing the boundaries of the variable block size. Indeed, it incurs some non-negligible overhead to perform a block read for each simple64 long word (simple64 frame), and this might be better to read more than one per block read.","
